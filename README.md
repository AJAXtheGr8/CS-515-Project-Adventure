<br>
<b>Hours spent on the project: </b> 10
<br>
<b>How was the code tested: </b> Tested by running the program and solving issues
<br>
<b>Any existing bugs:</b> No known bugs are present
<br>
<b>A difficult bug you resolved:</b> I was lost for the longest time on getting the ctrlD EOFError to work. After a painstaking 1 hour I realized that on Windows it's ctrlZ that raises the EOFError. Also, had to try testing on gradescope a few times to find the whitespace errors.
Another error was checking for the validity of maps, I got it down after few trial and errors,

<b>The three extensions implemented:</b>

- <b>The drop command:</b> Users can drop the pick the items and drop the items into any room
- <b>The unlock command:</b> Users can unlock a blocked direction in one of the rooms and 'go' in that direction to win the game. (Hint: It's the north direction in the 'banquet hall'. But, you will need to have the correct 2 items in your possession before it can work)
- <b>Directions as verbs:</b> Users can simply type directions to go in that direction without the need for a specific 'go' command
